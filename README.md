# Hexcloud Dataflow

Dataflow is a service and api that allows you to more easily ship your data to
the cloud. Using the api you create "flows" which allow you to stream and
upload files, transform that data, and ultimately place it in the cloud for use
by other systems or archival.

This repository contains helper scripts and examples for using the service.
